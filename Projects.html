                        This Is The Pioneering Point <br><br>

                        For this project I developed and built a stand-out professional identity and online portfolio for my whole graduating year. The aim was to create a site showing visual brand strength for impact, an innovative use of interaction/engagement on the web and disrupt elements of traditional web design.<br><br>

                        As part of creating a class identity, I had to develop a strong brand personality for the year group which includes a class manifesto. I used language and visuals to develop an exciting narrative with a strong authentic story.

                            I found a variety of different websites which were created using Webflow. Here are some websites which stood out to me which had an influence in my prototyping/planning stage. I annotated each screenshot with features that I had come across on each website which I wanted to implement in my own design.

                        <p>
                            This section contains design plans for my websites layout and content. Below are sketches of how I planned for my website to look as well as a higher fidelity prototype for my websites layouts and contents which will was created using Adobe Illustrator. This section also contains the process taken in creating my site branding pack. I will take you through my chosen theme, icons which I used, colour palette, type face and font size. These ideas have all stemmed from the research conducted in the previous stage.<br><br>

                            Contents:<br><br>

                            My site has 11 individual pages which are all be hyperlinked so that users are able to navigate around with ease. Below are the list of pages:<br><br>

                            Homepage (About page)<br>
                            Profile page (Containing my personal projects)<br>

                        <p>
                            These are images of the initial sketches which I had carried out which was the planning stage of my sites layout. These were rough sketches which helped me finalise my ideas on where I wanted certain features within my site to be displayed. This was later recorded in the high fidelity stage.<br><br>
                            
                            This design concept I had in mind for this website is to have most of the content all on one page. The only subpages within this design concept are the pages to showcase my work. The second sketch is a continuation of the page above which means the user will be able to see this part of the website when scrolling down.<br><br>
                            
                            The second page layout will be the same for every every member from my class. I decided to keep the layout the same to maintain consistency and a sense of professionalism as it will look organised. Having a different layout for each persons profile/work will confuse the user viewing my site as they will think they are viewing a different section of the site.

                        <p>
                            Through multiple sketch iterations, I created a higher fidelity mockup of the websites overall design using Adobe illustrator. I decided to create a whole new layout as I still wasn’t satisfied with the way features were arranged in the sketches.<br><br>
                            
                            These are some of the many illustrations which I had created during the planning stage of the project. These mockups are here to give you a better visual understanding of how they looked.<br>
                            The first sketch is part of the homepage. The second half of the sketch within the first sketch (below the grey page) is the continuation of the homepage. This means that when the user scrolls down the page, they will see the following content:<br><br>
                            
                            Profile Picture & Text: I planned for there to be 9 symmetrical boxes. This will contain a portrait image of each class member. The boxes will have two features. The first being, a button which is hyperlinked to a subpage that contains more information on a specific person, along with some of their previous/current projects.<br>The second feature will be, when the user hovers their cursor over a persons portrait image, the image will become blurred or have a darker opacity and a brief description about the person will appear.<br><br>
                            
                            The second sketch is the profile page for each class member. Every persons profile page will consist of the same layout. The user will be able to access this page by clicking on the persons portrait picture (displayed on the homepage). This section shows the layout for the people who want a video embedded to their page.

                        <p>
                            I conducted vigorous iterations to my site branding pack. Here is an example of the initial and final site branding pack I created.<br>
                            The initial site branding map I created consisted of images of maps. This is because I thought this resembled/translated the word ‘pioneer’. We look at a map to see our journey to a destination. In our UX/UI course, we are pioneering our way through to industry led companies. The UX/UI course being our ‘journey’ and the industry practice being our destination. Therefore, I was looking for images of maps.<br><br>

                            The use of images helped me in the second stage of completing my site branding pack as I had to look for colours. Instead of looking for a random colour palette like how I did initially. I used the same colours within the images. The use of the colours within the images begins to create a theme and a direction.<br><br>

                            Choosing the typography for my site was also made easy as I had thought to use the same font type which is used within the transport for London maps.<br><br>

                            However, looking at the outcome of this branding pack, I wasn’t satisfied with the font type or colours used. This is because the colours were all very different from each other which made me realise that they may not go well together if combine together in a site. The font type didn’t appeal to my liking either. Therefore I decided to go back and make some changes.<br><br>
                            
                            The second site branding pack (fourth page) I created had the same story concept. However, I had used different images to tell the same story. I used mountains as people can climb mountains, it can be quite difficult as there isn’t a set path to be able to walk to the top. I believed this translated my manifesto and the term ‘pioneer’ very well as I believe our journey in UX/UI has been difficult. We have encountered several problems and have managed to overcome them. It’s not an easy journey just like climbing a mountain. However, the destination is to reach the top of the mountain (this could be graduating, getting a job into an industry led company, getting the dream job).<br><br>

                            I used the same steps which I had taken when creating the first branding pack, in choosing the colours. I used the colours seen in the images.<br><br>

                            I had explored the range of fonts which google fonts offered. I chose to use a font-type where the readability of the text wouldn’t be effected despite the font weight or size. Open-sans stood out to me as it was formal and readable.

                            The theme which I chose for this project is: being a pioneer in UX/UI. The term ‘Pioneer’ stood out to me as I believe it defined all my fellow peers within my course. I believe that on a design course such as UX/UI, we are required to always explore, come up with new and innovative designs and ideas for all projects we encounter. Therefore, I felt like this word best described us as a collective <br><br>

                            The mountain illustration resembled our rocky path/journey to the top. The top of the mountain symbolises our end goal. Success! - whether that be Graduating or getting a placement at an industry led company…

                        I collaborated with Outernet for this project. Outernet is a global media and entertainment business comprising connected city-centre districts where music, film, art, gaming and retail experiences come to life in new breathtaking ways.<br><br>

                        This project required me to create an immersive experience for Outernets new building - located at Tottenham Court Road. The project was a university project which was a class challenge to create an immersive experience. The project which Outernet thought was the best would later be picked to be used for their launch at their new London site.
